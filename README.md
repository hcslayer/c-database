# SQLite Clone 
---
### A simple database in C 
#####  *Based on [cstack's tutorial](https://github.com/cstack/db_tutorial)*
---
**Overview**   
As it stands, the database code is boilerplate from the tutorial.  
However, the code is spaghetti, and it isn't quite complete.  
*(this is no slight to the original author, all spaghetti is my own)*  
My vision for this project is to expand and complete the database, as much as I am able.

**To Do**

- [x] Write a basic README 
- [x] Come back here and make this list more specific 
- [ ] Implement splitting the internal node 
- [ ] Write test clients
- [ ] Clean up the current header/implementation split 
- [ ] Clean up code and refactor naming conventions across files. 

**Updates / Changelog** 

July 19: Split the database into a db.c file and a main.c file, to separate the front-end-ey bits from the back-end-ey bits. Currently exploring how to implement the internal node splitting functionality.
