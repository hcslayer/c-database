This is the README for this project. 
Currently, I am following a tutorial to build a database in C. 
I would like to work within the tutorial to expand and modularize the program, and maybe even go as far cooking up a GUI for it. At the very least, there's lots of work to be done in cleaning up the project and working through all of the spaghetti code. 

I also need to write a more professional readme.
