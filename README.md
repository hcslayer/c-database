# SQLite Clone 
---
### A simple database in C 
#####  *Based on [cstack's tutorial](https://github.com/cstack/db_tutorial)*
---
**Overview**   
As it stands, the database code is boilerplate from the tutorial.  
However, the code is spaghetti, and it isn't quite complete.  
*(this is no slight to the original author, all spaghetti is my own)*  
My vision for this project is to expand and complete the database.  
---

**To Do**

- [x] Write a basic README 
- [ ] Establish a more modular framework for the database, splitting the files along logical lines. 
- [ ] Write header files for each module, and start to disassemble the program into chunks, debugging and configuring along the way. 
- [ ] Shorten some style conventions and get the code to a place of cleanness.
- [ ] Finish B-Tree implementation, with support for splitting internal nodes. 
- [ ] Come back here and make this to-do list a bit more specific.
